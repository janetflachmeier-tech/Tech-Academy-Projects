# JavaScripts-Projects


Welcome to my JavaScript Projects repository! 🌟

This space contains a curated collection of coding exercises, mini-apps, and creative explorations completed during my JavaScript course. Each project is designed to reinforce key concepts such as variables, functions, DOM manipulation, event handling, and asynchronous programming.

Whether you're browsing for inspiration or reviewing code for learning, I hope these projects offer insight into my growth as a developer. Feel free to explore, fork, or contribute!

Stay curious and keep coding ✨
