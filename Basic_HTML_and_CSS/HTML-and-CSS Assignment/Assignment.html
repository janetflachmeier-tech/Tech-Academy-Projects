		<h1>Welcome to My Dog Assignment Page</h1>
		<p>This is my very first webpage, created as part of my journey into learning HTML and web development. I'm excited to explore how code can bring ideas to life and reflect my personal growth.</p>
		<h3>My first milestone in web development</h3>
		<h6>Still learning, still smiling</h6>
		<p>Reaching this milestone in web development feels like unlocking a new language — one that turns ideas into visible, interactive experiences. Creating my first webpage has taught me not just about HTML tags and structure, but about patience, curiosity, and the joy of building something from scratch. This is more than code; it’s the beginning of a creative journey where every line reflects growth, intention, and possibility.
